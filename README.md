# Description of the penguins.ipynb notebook
***
This notebook contains my analysis of the famous Palmer Penguins dataset. Through this project, I aim to illustrate the practical application of Python-based data analysis techniques, highlighting the usefulness of this dataset for such applications. Beginning with a brief background and description of the dataset, I will move on to discuss the types of variables within it, and visualise two variables using a bar chart and a histogram, respectively. The second part of the notebook will focus on the correlation between two variables within the dataset, drawing the best-fit line to determine the type of correlation. I will then provide commentary on my findings and conclude with some areas for further investigation.
